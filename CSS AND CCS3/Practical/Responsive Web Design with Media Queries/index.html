                <p>That It started during a particularly stressful period in my life. I had a calendar packed with
                    commitments, a home filled with possessions I rarely used, and a constant feeling of being busy yet
                    accomplishing very little. The breaking point came when I realized I owned three separate vegetable
                    peelers but couldn't remember the last time I'd actually enjoyed cooking a meal.That's when I began
                    questioning: How had I accumulated so much—both physically and mentally—that meant so little? The
                    pursuit of simplicity became my path back to what truly matters.</p>

                <p>Letting go wasn't always easy. There were sentimental items I'd held onto for years and "just in
                    case" possessions that had been gathering dust. But with each bag I donated, I felt lighter. The
                    empty spaces in my home began to feel like room to breathe rather than something that needed
                    filling.The most surprising benefit wasn't the tidy space itself, but the mental clarity that came
                    with it. With less visual noise around me, I found myself more focused and less anxious. My home
                    transformed from a storage unit into a sanctuary.Now, cleaning takes minutes instead of hours, and I
                    actually know what I own</p>
