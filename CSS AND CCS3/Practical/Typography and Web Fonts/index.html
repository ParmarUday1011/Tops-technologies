    <h1 class="title">The Joy of Simple Living</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Finding contentment in a world of complexity</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>In a world that constantly shouts "more, more, more," I've discovered the quiet power of "enough." Simple living isn't about deprivation or moving to a remote cabin—it's about intentionally choosing what adds value to your life and letting go of what doesn't. This is my journey toward a more meaningful, less cluttered existence.</p>

        <h2>Why I Chose Simplicity</h2>
        <p>It started during a particularly stressful period in my life. I had a calendar packed with commitments, a home filled with possessions I rarely used, and a constant feeling of being busy yet accomplishing very little. The breaking point came when I realized I owned three separate vegetable peelers but couldn't remember the last time I'd actually enjoyed cooking a meal.</p>
        <p>That's when I began questioning: How had I accumulated so much—both physically and mentally—that meant so little? The pursuit of simplicity became my path back to what truly matters.</p>

        <h3>The First Steps: Decluttering My Space</h3>
        <p>I started with my physical environment, tackling one room at a time. The KonMari method resonated with me—keeping only what "sparks joy." I was astonished to discover that nearly 60% of my possessions didn't meet this simple criteria.</p>
        <p>Letting go wasn't always easy. There were sentimental items I'd held onto for years and "just in case" possessions that had been gathering dust. But with each bag I donated, I felt lighter. The empty spaces in my home began to feel like room to breathe rather than something that needed filling.</p>
        <p>The most surprising benefit wasn't the tidy space itself, but the mental clarity that came with it. With less visual noise around me, I found myself more focused and less anxious. My home transformed from a storage unit into a sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Now, cleaning takes minutes instead of hours, and I actually know what I own. The constant pressure to organize, maintain, and upgrade has virtually disappeared from my life.</p>

        <h2>Simplifying My Schedule</h2>
        <p>Physical clutter was only half the battle. The more insidious clutter was in my calendar. I was saying "yes" to everything and everyone, leaving little time for what I genuinely cared about.</p>
        <p>I started time-blocking, protecting certain hours for deep work, relaxation, and connection. I became more intentional about social commitments, recognizing that quality trumps quantity when it comes to relationships.</p>
        <p>The most radical change? I stopped glorifying "busy." When people ask how I am, I no longer feel compelled to list all my activities. "Content" or "peaceful" have become my honest responses.</p>
        <p>This intentional scheduling has created space for spontaneity—the good kind. Now I have time for impromptu coffee with a friend or an unexpected afternoon reading in the park.</p>

        <h3>The Ripple Effects</h3>
        <p>Living simply has transformed my relationship with money, time, and even myself. I'm more mindful about purchases, asking "Will this add value to my life?" rather than "Is this on sale?"</p>
        <p>I've rediscovered the pleasure of simple activities: brewing tea mindfully, taking walks without destination, writing letters instead of quick texts. These small moments have become the foundation of my contentment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest gift has been reconnecting with myself. In the quiet spaces I've created, I've remembered who I am beneath all the doing and having. I'm learning to measure my wealth not in possessions, but in peace.</p>
